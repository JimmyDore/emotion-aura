# Phase 6.1: Eye Wink Firework Particles - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Detect individual eye winks (and blinks) via FaceLandmarker blendshapes and trigger spectacular firework particle bursts on the corresponding screen side. Builds on existing face detection and particle system — no new dependencies.

## Implementation Decisions

### Visual effect
- Spectacular intensity: 150 particles per burst
- Long fade: lifetime 5.0-8.0 seconds — particles linger and drift
- Weightless/radial expansion — no gravity, particles spread outward evenly in all directions
- Colors: LEFT wink = GOLD, RIGHT wink = CYAN (not red/blue)
- Single point origin — all particles explode from one tight spot (classic firework)

### Wink sensitivity
- Medium threshold (0.5) for detecting closed eye — deliberate wink required
- Rapid fire cooldown: 250ms between triggers — wink fast for firework machine gun effect
- Both eyes closed (blink) = DOUBLE firework on BOTH sides simultaneously (gold left + cyan right)
- Blinks are a feature, not noise to filter

### Screen positioning
- Far out positioning: 80% toward screen edge (not 60%) — strong left/right separation
- Vertical center (y=0) for burst origin
- Single point origin, not diffuse area

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact speed range for particle radial velocity
- Particle size range
- Color jitter amount for visual richness
- Position offset (keep minimal since single-point origin chosen)

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Firework particles share the same ParticlePool as emotion aura — hand gestures (push/attract) automatically affect firework particles too
- "Firework machine gun" effect when winking rapidly is desired, not a bug
- Double blink firework should feel like a bonus, not an annoyance

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
